This project revolves around an insightful dashboard developed using Streamlit, which visualizes and analyzes vehicle sale data extracted from the Otomoto website, a prominent online automobile marketplace. The dataset, titled "Cleaned_Car_sale_ads2.csv," is a result of meticulous data scraping and subsequent cleaning to ensure high-quality and actionable insights. 

 

The data encompasses a wide array of variables associated with vehicle listings, such as 'Price', 'Condition', 'Vehicle_brand', 'Vehicle_model', 'Production_year', 'Mileage_km', 'Power_HP', 'Displacement_cm3', 'Fuel_type', and 'Offer_location', among others. These attributes offer a comprehensive view of each vehicle listing, facilitating multifaceted analyses ranging from pricing trends to brand popularity and vehicle specifications. 

 

The dashboard is designed to cater to diverse user needs, from potential buyers and sellers to automotive market analysts. It allows for interactive exploration of the data through various filters like brand, model, year of production, and mileage, enabling users to tailor the information to their specific requirements. Visual representations such as histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps provide intuitive insights into market trends, price distributions, and correlations between different vehicle attributes. 

 

The project not only serves as a practical tool for decision-making in the vehicle market but also stands as a testament to the effectiveness of web scraping in gathering real-time data for dynamic and up-to-date analysis. It demonstrates the synergy between web scraping techniques, data cleaning processes, and interactive data visualization in creating powerful tools for market analysis.
